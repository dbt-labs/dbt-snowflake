## dbt-snowflake 1.2.0 - July 26, 2022

### Fixes
- In multi-query statements, prepend all queries with query comments. Use the last non-`COMMIT` query to store metadata about the model result. **Note:** this restores previous (pre-v0.21) behavior for incremental models and snapshots, which will again correctly reflect the number of rows modified in `adapter_response.rows_affected` ([#140](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-snowflake/issues/140), [#147](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-snowflake/issues147140), [#153](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-snowflake/pull/153))
- Improve column comment handling when `persist_docs` is enabled ([#161](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-snowflake/pull/161))

### Features
- Add grants to materializations ([#168](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-snowflake/issues/168), [#178](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-snowflake/pull/178))
- Add set_query_tag and unset_query_tag to the dbt macro namespace ([#133](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-snowflake/issues/133), [#132](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-snowflake/pull/132))

### Under the hood

- Cleanup redundant precommit hook command ([#145](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-snowflake/pull/145))
- File rename to match reference to core ([#152](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-snowflake/pull/152))
