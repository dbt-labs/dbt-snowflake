**[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)** (data build tool) enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications.

dbt is the T in ELT. Organize, cleanse, denormalize, filter, rename, and pre-aggregate the raw data in your warehouse so that it's ready for analysis.

## dbt-snowflake

The `dbt-snowflake` package contains all of the code required to make dbt operate on a Snowflake database. For
more information on using dbt with Snowflake, consult [the docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/profile-snowflake).
