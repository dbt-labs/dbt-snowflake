body: In multi-query statements, prepend all queries with query comments. Use the
  last non-`COMMIT` query to store metadata about the model result. **Note:** this
  restores previous (pre-v0.21) behavior for incremental models and snapshots, which
  will again correctly reflect the number of rows modified in `adapter_response.rows_affected`.
